Zip Script V2 Write Up 05/05/2021 
By SPC Burgess, Drew J & By PFC Leonard, Reilly W

Brief Note: 
Zip Script V1 was never released outside of my unit but it made such an impact that we decided
to release it with the script collection for you all. In the future we will likely open source
all of our scripts but for now here is another addition to the script collect enjoy!



Mandatory Input "HOSTNAME or IPV4 ADDRESS"
Mandatory Directory Path + Filename
Mandatory File Name re-entry. 

Enter all of the required information.. Here is an example.
BLISWAEQT0NBXXX
\\ShareDrive\Directory\Directory\Filename.zip
Filename.zip

Official Instructions:

You'll first enter the destination hostname of the system you want to recieve the files.
Then copy and paste the path AND filename.zip of the file you want to copy.
Your last step is going to be just putting the same filename.zip, as the one in the path, in the final box. 

One last note I'd like to add.
You may click on the instructions button for a reiteration of what I stated above.
Awesome,now click LAUNCH!
